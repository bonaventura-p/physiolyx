# This cloudbuild.yaml file uses the custom cloud builder image called python-cloudbuild that can be built from
# the python-cloud-builder/ directory to run python CI steps
# In this example the file runs pytest and pylint.  User added steps can be incorporated as well.

#ADD ID
steps:
- name: 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/python-cloudbuild' # Cloud Build automatically substitutes $PROJECT_ID for your Project ID
  entrypoint: '/bin/bash'
  args: ['-c','virtualenv /workspace/venv' ]
  id: 'Python_venv'
  # Creates a Python virtualenv stored in /workspace/venv that will persist across container runs.
- name: 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/python-cloudbuild'
  entrypoint: 'venv/bin/pip'
  args: ['install', '-V', '-r', 'requirements.txt']
  id: 'Pytest_install'
  # Installs any dependencies listed in the project's requirements.txt.
- name: 'gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/python-cloudbuild'
  entrypoint: 'venv/bin/python'
  args: ['-m', 'pytest', '-v']
  id: 'Pytest_run'
  # runs pytest from the virtual environment (with all requirements)
  # using the verbose flag so you can see each individual test.
